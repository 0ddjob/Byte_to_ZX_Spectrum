# Byte_to_ZX_Spectrum
 Converter board for the Belarusian ZX Spectrum clone called the Байт (Byte). <br>
 
This machine has an, ahem, excessive 96-pin connector called an СНП59-96 (SNP59).  This connector has three rows of 32 pins each and is *almost* the same as a DIN41612 connector ... except for the Soviet-era 2.5mm pin pitch (compared to Western 2.54mm).  <br>

So a DIN41612 connector will not work.  That's the first issue.<br>

The second issue is, of course, it's not a Spectrum edge connector so peripherals won't connect anyway.

Current status (29-Aug-2023):<br>
- I have several connectors (hopefully) on their way from Ukraine (to Australia).<br>
- The board is ready for a test fabrication.<br>
- If it's all good then I'll upload the Gerber files as well (they can be generated from Kicad using the available files if you're really keen).
